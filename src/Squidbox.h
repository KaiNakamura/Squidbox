/**
 * @class Squidbox
 * @brief This class represents the Squidbox device.
 *
 * The Squidbox is a MIDI controller with a screen, a joystick, a knob, and
 * multiple buttons. It can switch between different scenes, each providing a
 * different functionality. For example, one scene might allow the user to play
 * notes, while another might allow the user to play chords.
 *
 * The Squidbox class manages the state of the device, including the current
 * scene, the state of the screen, joystick, knob, and buttons. It also manages
 * the initialization of the device and the transition between scenes.
 *
 * The class provides methods to initialize the device, update its state, switch
 * to a specific scene, and access its components (screen, joystick, knob, and
 * buttons).
